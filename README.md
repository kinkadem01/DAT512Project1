This project uses the Buffalo 311 service request data from Open Data Buffalo and analyzes some of the categorical variables to find trends in 311 reports. These trends are visualized mostly in the form of count charts, comparing the categorical variables of “Status” and “Object Type” to other location or time related variables. Using the charts, interesting conclusions can be made regarding the 331 report data.
